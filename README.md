a neat way to keep track of tricking videos on YT

Just tweaking the source code provided by Youtube and Google.

UPDATE: 4/14/2013

Trick FEED is now compatible with mobile devices. 

Changes:
- The app now uses iFrame embed instead of the flash embed
- The JS provided by the code lab was tweaked to allow execution of onclick function changeThisId() which would change the video ID and start up the video upon clicking

UPDATE: V2.0 4/17/2013

Changes:
- Mostly stylistic
- Used jQuery to add highlight effects
- Tweaked the CSS to have the feed on the left and the video on the right
